      <h2 class="ctm-h1">What is an Algorithm?</h2>
      <p>An algorithm is a set of well-defined steps, written to solve a problem or to accomplish a particular task. 
      The recipe of a dish is a good example of an algorithm.</p>

      <h2 class="ctm-h2">What is Programming?</h2>
      <p>Programming (also called Coding) is basically the process of encoding the human readable algorithm into a notation, a programming language (such as C++, Java, Python, etc.), so that it can be executed by a computer.</p>

      <h2 class="ctm-h3">What makes it exciting?</h2>
      <p>The joy of solving seemingly difficult problems, completely using logic and intuition is what makes programming an exciting field of study. Unlike other physical sciences, where the solution to a problem might be restricted by the laws of Physics, in Programming, the only barrier to coming up with a solution will be your thinking ability. Thus the prerequisite for getting started with programming is very low, and literally anyone, with a knack for creativity and logical thinking, can start enjoying the essence of Algorithms and Programming.</p>

    <div class="col-lg-7">  
      <p>This course introduces students about C++ programming language from scratch and covers the entire Syllabus. Students will be acquainted with various mathematical problems and algorithms to functionality of code and programs. Our course enables the feature of live classes with interactive sessions through video conferencing. The classes will be fashioned in such a way that maximum students can approach with their doubts to the faculties in live classroom. Every student will be nurtured equally with equal attention so that they can write the code , debug it and execute the code by themselves. Our course also envelops the extra MATHS SESSIONS to enhance problem solving abilities of students and implement them in the programs . Every content will be taught in a simplistic manner to grasp the concepts better.</p>
